Entity Linking Scoring Script

version 0.6:
December 17, 2011
By Hoa Dang (hoa.dang@nist.gov)

1. Changed the header of the output table (replace "B^3" with "B^3+";
and replace "B^2" with "B^3").

2. Changed the way that scores are computed for subsets of queries from
the complete eval data, to allow a more meaningful comparison of the
same system across different subsets of the eval data.

In v0.4, to compute the B^3 F-score for a set of queries Q1 that is a
subset of the entire set of queries Q in the eval data, all queries
except for those in Q1 are removed from both the gold standard and
system submission before computing query-level precision and recall.
However, this biases the comparison of the same system's performance
across different subsets (specifically, between Q1 vs Q), because of
the different number of queries involved in the computation of
query-level precision.
Let {Q1, Q2, ... ,Qn} be a partition of Q.  Then for any Qi in the
partition, and any query q in Qi, the query-level precision and recall
of q is such that:
    B^3 Recall(q|Q) == B^3 Recall(q|Qi)
    B^3 Precision(q|Q) <= B^3 Precision(q|Qi).
That is, the query-level precision of q given a universe containing
only queries of type i, is generally higher than the query-level
precision of q given a universe containing queries of type i, plus
additional queries; the query-level Recall of q is the same in both
universes.  Therefore, each query q generally contributes less to
overall B-cubed F-score in the context of Q than in the context of any
subset of Q; and it's possible for the B^3 F-score of Q to be lower
than the B^3 F-score of *every* element in a partition of Q (when
the B^3 F-scores of the elements in the partition are very similar).

V0.6 supports comparison of a system's performance on different
subsets of an eval set Q by computing query-level precision and recall
with respect to the entire eval set Q.
The v0.6 scorer requires specification of both the "complete"
gold-standard linking, and gold standard linkings for a "focus" subset
of queries. The v0.6 scorer:
 (1) Computes [B^3 or B^3+] precision and recall for each query in the
     complete gold standard, within the environment defined by all
     queries in the complete gold standard;

 (2) Computes *average* precision and recall for the set of *focus*
     queries by taking the average of the query-level precision and
     recall of the focus queries.
 (3) Computes [B^3 or B^3+] F-score from the average precision and
     recall in (2)



version 0.5:
October 14, 2011
By Hoa Dang (hoa.dang@nist.gov)
Also print standard B^3 scores (sometimes called b2 in this implementation)

version 0.4:
September 30, 2011
By Hoa Dang (hoa.dang@nist.gov)
Allow queries in gold standard to be a subset of the queries in the
system output; discard all queries in the system output that are not
in the gold standard.  In this way, scores can be broken down by
different query types.

version 0.3
September 14, 2011
By Hoa Dang (hoa.dang@nist.gov)
Fixed computation of kbp2010_microaverage function to treat all NIL
labels as equivalent.
Added F1 score as official KBP 2011 score.

version 0.2:
May 11, 2011
By Javier Artiles (CUNY, javart@gmail.com)
Fixed bug in 'sameLinking' function (thanks to Timothy Nyberg) that
prevented NIL elements with different identifiers on the gold std. and
sys output sides from matching

version 0.1
March 2, 2011
By Javier Artiles (CUNY, javart@gmail.com)
Initial script.
In KBP2011, we have a new requirement for entity linking, which is to
cluster NIL queries. For a set of query names with source documents,
an entity linking system is required to: (1) judge whether each query
can be linked to any KB node; (2) Cluster all queries with NIL KB
entries into clusters.  Ultimately the system output can be viewed as
a collection of various clusters; some clusters are labeled as KB node
IDs. At the same time the answer key can also be viewed as a different
collection of clusters.  Therefore we will apply a modified B-Cubed
metric (called B-Cubed+) to evaluate these clusters.
